# This script won't work after 24 Feb 2023, because *twitch*.

I won't be updating it to the new API, see [my comment on issue #3](https://github.com/NotNotQuinn/twitch-chat-colorchanger/issues/3#issuecomment-1435914185).

> 2. Open a terminal in the directory the code is in.

> 6. Run `node .` in the command line to start the program.
> 
> ## Configuration
> - `username`
>   - This is your username, it must be in lowercase
>   - This must be a `string`
> - `oauth`
>   - This is an oauth token to login to chat, you can get one here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ (you dont need the "oauth:" part)
>   - This must be a `string`
> - `seconds`
>   - This is how often the script will send a new color, you have to keep this in twitch ratelimits. See https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide#command--message-limits for more information.
>   - Just dont set it super low basicly, 10 seconds is as low as I would go. Its good to keep in mind that if you plan on spamming, you can only spam up to 20 messages per 30 seconds without mod/vip and this will be part of that. (if you go over you wont be able to send any messages in channels you arent a sub/mod/vip in for about 30 mins)
>   -  This must be a `number`
> - `usePrimeColors`
>   - If this is set to `true`, it will use prime colors, otherwise it uses the basic twitch colors.
>   - Requires Prime Gaming, or Twitch Turbo, they both give access to extended colors.
>   - This must be a `bool` (`true` or `false`)
> - `useRainbow`
>   - Does NOTHING if `usePrimeColors` is `false`
>   - If this is set to `true`, it will send a color from the rainbow and go through it.
>   - This must be a `bool` (`true` or `false`)
> - `rainbowSpeed`
>   - This is how much the hue of the rainbow changes every color.
>   - Negative numbers will go through the rainbow backwords.
>   - This must be a `number`
> - `rainbowStartHue`
>   - This is an offset added to the color's hue before the first color is sent.
>   - This must be a `number`
> - `onlyChangeColorOnMessageSent`
>   - If this is `true` your color will only change when you send a message, but the script will only see messages in the list of channels to check, seen below.
>   - This must be a `bool` (`true` or `false`)
> 
> Also to note: 
> - `channels.txt`
>   - every line in this file will be a channel that the script joins (if you have it set up that way.) Lines starting with a '#' are ignored, and so are empty lines.
> 
> ## Use
> 
> ### Chat commands
> 
> This script has a few chat commands. They will only respond in your channel to avoid "adding bots" to peoples chats that they dont want. Only you can use these commands. The commands:
> 
> - `"toggleColor"`
>   - Turn color on/off
> - `"addColor"`
>   - adds the channel to the channels that change color
>     for example: "`addColor justin`" will add `justin` to the channels text file and join it.
